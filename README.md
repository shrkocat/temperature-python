# Temperature Converter
This small project is programmed in **Python** where you will input your temperature, and declare what its unit of temperature is initially and to the desired converted unit. 

## Input Statements
This project contains simple "***float(input(""))***" structure in order to accept specified temperature with decimal places. With string values accompannied inside parenthesis to display what the program asks in order to execute.

## Conditional Statements
This project utilizes several lines of "***if***, ***elif***, and ***else***" statements in order for the program to understand whether inputted value in the terminal is either correct or valid. With "***round()***" in order to round off the computed temperature into a specified decimal value.
